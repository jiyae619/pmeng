[0:00] If it's too hard to repeat, it's not
[0:02] discipline. It's your ego. That is how
[0:05] you behave your way into confidence.
[0:07] Every time that you dodge the truth, you
[0:09] lose respect. The fear will be the
[0:11] strongest before you have the
[0:13] breakthrough.
[0:17] Discipline should feel hard. If it's too
[0:19] hard to repeat, it's not discipline,
[0:22] it's your ego. So, I remember I went to
[0:24] it was called body pump. Body Pump was
[0:26] where you would do like 30 reps of one
[0:28] exercise four times. And I remember I
[0:31] went to Body Pump three days in a row
[0:32] and then I went home and I went to go
[0:34] upstairs to my room and I collapsed
[0:37] trying to walk up the stairs. And so
[0:39] what I realized is that if something
[0:41] feels too hard or too punishing or it's
[0:45] too advanced too soon, you're going to
[0:47] associate it with negativity and you'll
[0:49] avoid it. You're essentially punishing
[0:51] yourself. And then when we punish
[0:52] ourselves, that means we also avoid the
[0:54] thing that could potentially lead to
[0:55] punishment. So if every time I work out,
[0:58] I hurt really bad after, I'm going to
[0:59] eventually avoid working out because I
[1:01] know what comes after working out is
[1:02] feeling really bad and sore after. We
[1:04] want to make our tasks so achievable
[1:06] that we feel good after we've done them.
[1:08] And then what happens is if we do
[1:10] something, we feel good after we do it.
[1:12] Then we want to do it again because we
[1:14] like doing things that feel good. High
[1:16] performers, they're not going to be
[1:17] sharper longer than somebody else. They
[1:18] just know when they're not. and to delay
[1:20] the decision. There's somebody that's
[1:21] probably before your time if you're
[1:22] watching this video, but his name is
[1:23] Brian Tracy and he popularized this idea
[1:25] and I remember it to this day, which is
[1:27] called Eat the Frog. The [music] premise
[1:28] is this. If you had to eat a live frog
[1:31] every morning, like it's live. This
[1:33] thing's like flapping in your mouth,
[1:34] right? Everything else would be like,
[1:36] "Dude, it's a breeze. I ate a frog this
[1:38] morning." That frog represents your
[1:41] hardest, highest leverage task. Okay?
[1:43] The one that you would avoid, but that
[1:45] would move your life forward the most
[1:47] because we know eating frogs is
[1:48] powerful. Identify something you've been
[1:51] avoiding. Now, we're going to plan to do
[1:52] it first thing tomorrow morning. We are
[1:54] going to execute it before you check
[1:55] your [music]
[1:56] email, your Slack, your Instagram, your
[1:58] Facebook, your WhatsApp, your Signal. I
[2:00] don't know what you use, but before
[2:02] everything, you're just going to do
[2:03] that. And you're going to say, "I am not
[2:04] allowed to do anything else until it's
[2:06] done. Do the hard thing first. Reward
[2:08] yourself second." Choosing to tolerate
[2:10] fear and discomfort is how I've been
[2:12] able to transform everything that I have
[2:14] done, everything I've been terrified
[2:16] from. From content creation to public
[2:17] speaking to running a giant company to
[2:19] buying multiple buildings. Here's the
[2:20] thing. Fear is a mile wide and an inch
[2:23] deep. Fear means your brain is working
[2:25] properly. It's not wrong that you feel
[2:28] scared. Your brain is wired for
[2:30] survival, not success. It will continue
[2:32] to feel scared until you do the thing.
[2:34] The fear will be the strongest before
[2:37] you have the breakthrough. Say you're
[2:38] terrified [music] of public speaking.
[2:39] You're going to step on that stage. This
[2:41] happens to me every time. Mouth dry.
[2:42] Then within 15 seconds, my heart rate
[2:44] starts to go from like 190 to like 150.
[2:47] And then within [music] a minute, I
[2:48] start to feel like I've spit in my mouth
[2:49] again. And then within two minutes, I
[2:51] don't feel any of it. It's not because I
[2:53] try to get rid of the fear. It's because
[2:54] I didn't run away from the situation.
[2:56] What I learned in doing all these things
[2:58] is that my emotions follow my emotion.
[3:00] That is how you behave your way into
[3:03] confidence. [music] And you build up so
[3:04] much evidence that it would be
[3:06] unreasonable not to be confident.
[3:08] Speaking truthfully without emotionally
[3:11] vomiting. A lot of people lose respect
[3:13] for themselves because of what they say
[3:15] to other people and then they walk away
[3:17] thinking I shouldn't have said that.
[3:19] This is when people speak from unmanaged
[3:21] discomfort rather than speaking
[3:23] truthfully in alignment with the results
[3:25] they want. A question I ask myself all
[3:27] the time is what do I want to have
[3:29] happen from this conversation? Like
[3:31] what's the action I want this person to
[3:32] take? People go around in the workplace,
[3:34] in their friendships, in their
[3:35] relationships, emotionally vomiting
[3:37] because it feels good in the short term
[3:38] and it feels really bad in the long term
[3:40] because you don't build that
[3:41] self-respect. And so, if you think about
[3:42] it, self-respect is like fitness. You
[3:44] just do it one rep at a time. Every time
[3:46] you choose not to betray yourself and
[3:48] every time you betray yourself, you lose
[3:50] self-respect. Because here's the thing,
[3:52] people who really respect themselves,
[3:53] they just leave situations and people
[3:55] who don't respect them, they don't
[3:56] complain about it. And they certainly
[3:58] don't YouTube, Google, search videos
[4:00] about it. They just dip. they ghost them
[4:03] and they leave. So self-respect is built
[4:05] in systems that make it easy for us to
[4:07] keep promises to ourselves. Success does
[4:10] not discriminate. Confidence does
[4:11] [music] not discriminate. It doesn't
[4:12] care where you've come from. It doesn't
[4:15] care about your background. It doesn't
[4:16] [music] care about your experience. All
[4:17] it cares about is the fact that you put
[4:20] in the work to get it. Here's the thing.
[4:22] Your brain gathers evidence. And
[4:24] evidence is what builds the identity and
[4:26] confidence over time. Our brains like to
[4:29] predict [music]
[4:29] what's likely to happen. If you've never
[4:31] done something before, your brain says,
[4:33] "I don't know what could happen, so I'm
[4:35] [music] going to make you scared." And
[4:37] if you're scared, you're going to avoid
[4:38] it, which means that you won't die.
[4:40] Right? Because our brains are wired for
[4:42] survival, not success. And so, it is
[4:45] crazy [music] to think that you would
[4:46] actually have confidence when you
[4:47] haven't done the thing yet. You will
[4:49] become confident once you've done the
[4:50] thing because your brain does it. It
[4:52] [music] sees you didn't die and it says,
[4:53] "It's okay. You can do it again." Now,
[4:54] here's the thing. I wasn't like forever
[4:56] confident now because [music] just like
[4:58] a muscle that you work out gets weak if
[5:00] you don't put it under [music] pressure,
[5:02] so does confidence. Confidence is like a
[5:04] muscle. So if you don't work out that
[5:06] muscle, it's just going to get weaker
[5:07] and weaker over time. We measure people
[5:09] by what they cost you, not what they
[5:11] say. Just because somebody talks up a
[5:13] big game doesn't mean that they should
[5:14] be in your life. If somebody makes it
[5:16] harder to behave like the person I
[5:18] respect being, they are too expensive to
[5:20] have in my life. like no matter how
[5:22] charming, how connected or how important
[5:24] they are. People ask me all the time,
[5:25] "Lila, what do I do? My boss, I know
[5:28] they don't respect me. How do I manage
[5:29] them up?" You don't. You leave. Person's
[5:32] not going to change because of you.
[5:33] People barely can get themselves to
[5:34] change. And I know that you're probably
[5:35] thinking, "Well, but this job, I can't
[5:37] get another job or like this is my
[5:39] business partner. Like, I have to make
[5:40] it work or I've been married for this."
[5:41] Like, I understand. But at the same
[5:43] time, there's a quote that comes to mind
[5:45] every time I think of this, which is
[5:46] like the definition of insanity is doing
[5:48] the same thing over and over and over
[5:50] again expecting a different result. The
[5:52] situation won't change unless you do.
[5:53] And you don't change by wanting. You
[5:55] don't change by wishing. And you don't
[5:56] change by feeling. You change by doing
[5:58] something different. Someone can't
[5:59] disrespect you if you leave the
[6:00] situation. And so allowing someone to
[6:03] continually disrespect us is when you
[6:05] give away your own power. Discipline
[6:06] means stopping a behavior immediately,
[6:08] but that almost always fails. So you
[6:10] don't need to be perfect right away. You
[6:12] just need to take a step towards the
[6:14] next best alternative. [music]
[6:15] What you want to do is identify a
[6:17] realistic better not perfect alternative
[6:20] to your habit. So instead of drinking
[6:22] vodka, maybe you drink a seltzer.
[6:25] Instead of drinking a seltzer, maybe you
[6:27] have a craft beer. Instead of a craft
[6:29] beer, maybe you're going to have a
[6:31] non-alcoholic beer. Maybe then instead
[6:33] of a non-alcoholic beer, then you're
[6:35] going to have a diet coke. And then
[6:37] after a diet coke, you're going to say,
[6:38] "I'm going to have a sparkling water."
[6:39] And you see how it goes. It's like you
[6:41] take tiny little steps. You don't just
[6:43] make the big swing all at once. And
[6:45] [music] so small steps in the right
[6:47] direction turn into big changes over
[6:50] time. It's just that most people are so
[6:51] impatient with themselves, they don't
[6:53] allow themselves to get there and they
[6:54] stay stuck in this cycle of going big
[6:56] change and then back out. Big change
[6:59] again, back out. Stop seeking approval.
[7:02] Every time that you wait for somebody
[7:04] else to say go, you give them control
[7:06] over your future. You want to have your
[7:08] own approval and approval from what I
[7:10] would call like your future board of
[7:12] directors who are the people you look up
[7:14] to. Would they approve of you doing
[7:15] this? Most people are waiting for
[7:17] permission from people who aren't even
[7:19] where they want to be and aren't even
[7:20] achieving their own goals, let alone
[7:22] helping you achieve yours. They ask
[7:24] their parents, they ask [music] their
[7:25] spouse, they asking 12,000 people on
[7:27] social media and then they feel more
[7:29] confused because you have contrary
[7:30] evidence. [music] You feel more confused
[7:32] because the thing is this, asking for
[7:33] opinions does not [music] create
[7:35] clarity. Action creates clarity. Most
[7:37] people give you advice based on their
[7:39] fears, not on their knowledge. And so
[7:42] they're giving you advice based on what
[7:43] didn't work for them didn't work for
[7:45] their dad, mom, spouse, partner,
[7:48] brother, whatever it is. And here's the
[7:49] thing, anyone who's successful, anyone
[7:51] who makes money, you know how they got
[7:53] there? By conviction, not consensus of
[7:56] everybody in their life. I would even go
[7:57] so far to say this. If everybody
[7:59] approves of your decision, it's probably
[8:01] wrong. Discipline isn't sexy. It is
[8:03] boring. And boring is what scales.
[8:05] Boring is what works. People say all the
[8:07] time, "I would love to see a day in your
[8:09] life, Leila." And I'm like, "Well,
[8:10] that's boring as my life is a series of
[8:12] systems strung together every day. I
[8:14] have a system for every aspect of my
[8:16] life." But here's the thing, those
[8:18] systems, those are discipline and
[8:20] they're real. Are they boring? For sure,
[8:22] they look boring from the outside, but
[8:23] they get the results that I'm looking
[8:25] for in my life. Doing simple things
[8:27] consistently is what actually leads to
[8:29] massive success. I have literally never
[8:31] had a time where I have woken up on a
[8:33] single day and thought,"I want to do
[8:35] every single thing today." Because most
[8:37] days I wake up, I at least don't want to
[8:39] do one thing. I don't want to do the
[8:40] workout. I don't want to talk to the
[8:42] person. I don't want to have the hard
[8:43] conversation. I don't want to do the
[8:45] interview. But I also know that feelings
[8:47] are fleeting. And I want the long-term
[8:49] satisfaction of knowing that I can stick
[8:51] with something, knowing I have control
[8:53] over myself, and knowing that I've
[8:54] mastered something. Discipline is not
[8:56] just going to bring you closer to your
[8:57] goals. It's going to bring you closer to
[8:59] the person that you want to be. Stop
[9:01] avoiding hard conversations. People
[9:03] won't say it out loud, but they are
[9:05] counting every single time that you
[9:07] avoid doing the hard thing. Every time
[9:08] that you dodge the truth, you lose
[9:10] respect. And so, executive presence
[9:12] means being the one who will say what
[9:14] others won't say. [music] I remember
[9:16] there was a quote from Mark Zuckerberg
[9:17] that I actually really like and he said,
[9:18] "Your job as a CEO is to be a trutht
[9:20] teller. You have to tell the truth even
[9:22] if nobody else will." So, what you want
[9:23] to do is you want to replace avoidance
[9:26] with confrontation. It's not that you
[9:28] just want to confront people and loosely
[9:30] call people out, act like an
[9:32] but you want to confront them with
[9:33] composure. And what that means is you
[9:34] want to be honest because when you're
[9:36] honest, that builds trust. When you
[9:37] soften the truth, when you avoid the
[9:39] truth, you create confusion. And when
[9:41] you name names, you become the person to
[9:43] look for when you want solutions.
